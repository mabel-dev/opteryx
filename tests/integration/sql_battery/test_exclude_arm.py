The best way to test a SQL Engine is to throw queries at it.

Note: These are not excluded due to compatibility problems. We use a 1GB Raspberry Pi
for ARM tests. We have come tests that are pusrposefully large to test what happens
at those limits. We exclude those from the ARM test suite because of our limited
memory management means we know we will crash on the Raspberry Pi.
