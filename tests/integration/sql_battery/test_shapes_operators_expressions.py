The best way to test a SQL Engine is to throw queries at it.

This is part of a suite of tests which are based on running many SQL statements.

This file tests: Operators, expressions, and infix calculations

This tests that the shape of the response is as expected: the right number of columns,
the right number of rows and, if appropriate, the right exception is thrown.
