"""
This module tests the ability to read from DuckDB using the SQLConnector.

DuckDB is used to rigorously test the SQLConnector due to its in-memory nature,
which allows for fast and efficient testing without the overhead of disk I/O.
This enables more intensive testing without the limitations of disk-based databases.

DuckDB appears to not like being tested in GitHub actions, so we run this suite
a little differently. We first create the DuckDB database, then we run the tests as
one function call, rather than it appearing as a test per statement as we do in other
battery test suites.

Note: DuckDB includes additional tests beyond the standard battery. However,
due to DuckDB's unstable file format, it only covers a subset of the required use
cases to save time, as loading it with numerous different tables can be time-consuming.
