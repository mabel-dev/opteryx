"""
This module tests the ability to read from SQLite using the SQLConnector.

SQLite is used to rigorously test the SQLConnector due to its local file nature,
which avoids contention with remote services. This allows for more intensive
testing without the overhead of network latency or remote service limitations.

Note: DuckDB also includes additional tests beyond the standard battery. However,
due to DuckDB's unstable file format, it only covers a subset of the required use
cases to save time, as loading it with numerous different tables can be time-consuming.
