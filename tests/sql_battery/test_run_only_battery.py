"""
The best way to test a SQL Engine is to throw queries at it.

This is part of a suite of tests which are based on running many SQL statements.

 >  Run Only
    Shape Checking
    Results Checking
    Compare to DuckDB

This is the lightest of the battery tests, it only ensures a query executes.

This may seem pointless as a test if that is all it is doing, but this has it's uses,
particularly in testing SQL parsing based problems/features - we don't care if the
result is right, if the engine can't parse the statements.

However, this is the lowest value of the SQL battery tests, all we know after running
this set is that the statements parse and the resulting query executes without error.
We don't know if the query parsed correctly or if the result is correct.

It currently takes less than a second to run the whole set, and it gives us some
confidence in the function of the engine.
