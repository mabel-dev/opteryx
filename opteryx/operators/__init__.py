Physical Execution Operators

This module contains all physical execution operators used by Opteryx's query engine.
Operators form a tree structure where each node processes data and passes results to
its parent node, implementing the iterator pattern for memory-efficient processing.

Operator Categories:

Data Sources:
- ReaderNode: Reads data from connectors (files, databases, etc.)
- AsyncReaderNode: Async version for improved I/O performance
- FunctionDatasetNode: Generates data from function calls

Joins:
- InnerJoinNode: Standard inner joins
- OuterJoinNode: Left, right, and full outer joins
- CrossJoinNode: Cartesian product joins
- NestedLoopJoinNode: Nested loop algorithm for joins
- UnnestJoinNode: Specialized join for array unnesting

Filtering and Selection:
- FilterNode: Applies WHERE clause predicates
- FilterJoinNode: Optimized filter for join conditions
- ProjectionNode: Column selection and expression evaluation
- DistinctNode: Removes duplicate rows

Aggregation:
- AggregateNode: Standard aggregation (SUM, COUNT, etc.)
- AggregateAndGroupNode: GROUP BY with aggregation
- SimpleAggregateNode: Single-group aggregation optimization
- SimpleAggregateAndGroupNode: Optimized single-group with GROUP BY

Sorting and Limiting:
- SortNode: ORDER BY implementation using TimSort
- HeapSortNode: Heap-based sorting for TOP-N queries
- LimitNode: LIMIT/OFFSET clause implementation

Set Operations:
- UnionNode: UNION and UNION ALL operations

Control and Meta:
- ExitNode: Query execution termination
- ExplainNode: Query plan explanation
- ShowColumnsNode: SHOW COLUMNS implementation
- ShowCreateNode: SHOW CREATE VIEW implementation
- ShowValueNode: SHOW variable value display
- SetVariableNode: SET variable operations

Base Classes:
- BasePlanNode: Base class for all operators
- JoinNode: Base class for join operators

Operator Development:
1. Inherit from BasePlanNode or appropriate base class
2. Implement execute() method that processes data morsels
3. Handle memory management and resource cleanup
4. Support statistics collection for optimization
5. Add comprehensive tests

Example:
    class MyOperatorNode(BasePlanNode):
        def execute(self, morsel):
            # Process the data morsel
            processed_data = self.process_data(morsel)
            yield processed_data

Performance Considerations:
- Use vectorized operations with PyArrow when possible
- Implement memory pooling for large data processing
- Consider async operations for I/O bound operators
- Profile memory usage and optimize accordingly
