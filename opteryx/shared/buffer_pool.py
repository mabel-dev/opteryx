Global Buffer Pool.

This is uses an LRU-K2 policy to determine what to keep and what to evict and is
backed by a MemoryPool.

The buffer pool has no slot limit, it is a given volume of memory, the pool
will try to evict when full. This is different to a classic Buffer Pool which
is slot-based.

The Buffer Pool is a global resource and used across all Connections and Cursors.
