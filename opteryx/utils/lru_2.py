LRU-K evicts the morsel whose K-th most recent access is furthest in the past. Note, the
LRU doesn't evict, it has no "size", the caller decides when the cache is full, this
could be slot/count based (100 items), or this could be volume-based (32Mb).

This is a basic implementation of LRU-2, which evicts entries according to the time of their
penultimate access. The main benefit of this approach is to prevent a problem when the items being
getted exceeds the number of items in the cache. A classic LRU will evict and repopulate the cache
for every call. LRU-2 reduces the likelihood of this, but not preferring the MRU item to be
retained.

LRU-K should be used in conjunction with eviction limits per query - this appears to broadly be
the solution used by Postgres. This can be supported by the calling function using the return from
the .set call to determine if an item was evicted from the cache.

This can also be used as the index for an external cache (for example in plasma), where the set()
returns the evicted item which the calling function can then evict from the external cache.

This is a variation of LRU-K, where an item has fewer than K accesses, it is not evicted unless
all items have fewer than K accesses. Not being evicted adds an access to age out single-hit items
from the cache. The resulting cache provides opportunity for novel items to prove their value before
being evicted.

If n+1 items are put into the cache in the same 'transaction', it acts like a FIFO - although
the BufferPool implements limit to only evict up to 32 items per 'transaction'
