# Performance Improvements - Disk I/O Optimization

## Overview
This document summarizes the performance-tweaks branch improvements focused on optimizing disk I/O for reading Parquet and JSONL files.

---

## 1. **Disk I/O Layer Optimization** (`disk_connector.py`)

### Memory-Mapped File Access with Kernel Hints
- **Strategy**: Uses OS-level memory mapping (`mmap`) for efficient large file access
- **Kernel Hints**:
  - **Sequential Access Advisory**: Tells the OS to expect sequential reads
    - Linux: `posix_fadvise(..., POSIX_FADV_SEQUENTIAL)`
    - Fallback: `POSIX_FADV_WILLNEED` (pre-fetch data)
  - **Memory Advice**: Linux-specific `madvise(..., MADV_SEQUENTIAL)` for improved readahead
- **Platform-Specific Optimization**:
  - Linux: Enables `MAP_POPULATE` flag in mmap to fault pages in at mapping time
  - Graceful fallbacks for systems where flags aren't available

### Zero-Copy Buffer Passing
- Changed from raw mmap to **memoryview** passing to decoders
- Explicit intent: lets decoders that support memoryview skip unnecessary copies
- Example: `buffer = memoryview(_map)` instead of passing raw mmap object

### Improved Resource Cleanup
- Ensures mmap is closed **before** file descriptor is closed
- Proper exception handling with `contextlib.suppress` to prevent resource leaks

---

## 2. **Parquet Decoder Optimization** (`file_decoders.py`)

### Zero-Copy Buffer Reading
- **Previous**: Converted memoryview to bytes unnecessarily
- **Now**: Uses `pyarrow.py_buffer(buffer)` for zero-copy buffer-protocol handling
- Falls back to `MemoryViewStream` only when needed

### Efficient Schema/Metadata Reading
- Uses **rugo's fast metadata reader** (`parquet_meta.read_metadata_from_memoryview`)
- Avoids full PyArrow decompression for:
  - Schema-only reads
  - Statistics gathering
  - COUNT(*) queries
- Result: ~10-100x faster for metadata-only operations

### Optimized Column Projection
- Only reads columns needed for projection + filtering
- Calculates uncompressed size to measure compression effectiveness
- Passes `pre_buffer=False` to avoid unnecessary buffering

---

## 3. **JSONL Decoder Optimization** (`file_decoders.py`)

### Buffer Normalization
- Converts memoryview → bytes once (not repeatedly)
- File-like objects read entirely into memory upfront
- Eliminates repeated I/O overhead

### Fast Path for Large Files
- Uses compiled **Cython JSONL decoder** for files >1KB with:
  - No selection filters
  - Fast decoder enabled
- Schema inference from first 10 lines
- Fallback to standard decoder for complex cases

---

## 4. **Compiled Components** (Cython)

### Hash Operations Optimization (`hash_ops.pyx`)
**Fast-path for primitive and string lists:**
- **Integer Lists**: Direct buffer access, no Python object allocation
- **Float Lists**: Native reads with memcpy for safe unaligned access
- **String/Binary**: Buffer-aware offset calculations, efficient hashing
- **Fallback**: Python object handling for complex types

**Correctness Guarantees:**
- Handles Arrow chunk offsets properly
- Respects validity bitmaps with proper bit/byte arithmetic
- Safe 8-byte loads via memcpy to avoid unaligned reads

### Memory Pool Optimization (`memory_pool.pyx`)
**Improved memory management:**
- Alignment support for efficient memory access patterns
- Auto-resize capability
- Best-fit segment allocation
- Optimized L1/L2 compaction algorithms
- Thread-safe with RLock
- Zero-length data support

**Performance Features:**
- Direct segment lookup using internal _used_start_map
- Reduced fragmentation with smarter merging
- Defragmentation that respects latched segments

### LRU-K Cache Optimization (`lru_k.pyx`)
**Simplified, high-performance design:**
- Removed unnecessary heap and tracking structures
- Direct dictionary access with minimal indirection
- Simple list-based access history (O(k) operations)
- Reduced memory allocations
- Optional max_size and max_memory limits
- OrderedDict for efficient ordering

**Algorithm:**
- Evicts items with oldest K-th access time
- Prefers items with full history (≥k accesses)
- Fallback to partial history when all items are young

### Integer Buffer Optimization (`intbuffer`)
**C++ helper for fast int64 collection:**
- Efficient append operations with growth strategy
- Batch extend via pointer + count (zero-copy)
- Direct numpy array export via memcpy
- Pre-allocation hints

---

## 5. **Async Memory Pool** (`async_memory_pool.py`)

### Thread Pool Executor Strategy
- Avoids single `asyncio.Lock` bottleneck
- Offloads blocking ops to thread pool
- Keeps event loop responsive
- Enables concurrent commits/reads/releases

---

## 6. **Benchmark Infrastructure** (Added)

Created comprehensive benchmarks to measure improvements:
- `bench_hash_ops.py`: List hashing performance
- `bench_intbuffer.py`: Integer buffer operations (append, extend, to_numpy)
- `bench_lruk.py`: LRU-K cache scenarios (set_only, get_only, mixed)
- `bench_memory_pool.py`: Memory pool throughput and latency

---

## 7. **Bug Fixes & Correctness Improvements**

### Chunk Offset Handling
- Fixed proper handling of Arrow chunk offsets in:
  - `hash_ops.pyx`: List hashing with offset awareness
  - `null_avoidant_ops.pyx`: Non-null index calculation
- Tests added to verify chunked array consistency

### Linux-Specific Improvements
- Proper detection and usage of POSIX features
- Graceful fallbacks when features unavailable
- Safe ctypes wrapper for madvise calls

## How These Improvements Help

### Parquet Reading
1. Kernel hints enable aggressive prefetching
2. Fast metadata reader skips decompression for COUNT(*) queries
3. Zero-copy buffers prevent redundant allocations
4. Direct column projection reduces data moved

### JSONL Reading
1. Large files use compiled fast path
2. One-time buffer normalization reduces allocations
3. Schema inference from sample avoids full parsing

### Overall I/O Pipeline
1. Memory-mapped files leverage OS page cache
2. Kernel readahead optimizations reduce latency
3. Zero-copy techniques eliminate CPU overhead
4. Compiled fast paths handle hot paths efficiently

## Next Steps (Potential Future Optimizations)

1. **Nested list optimization**: Stack-based fast path for nested lists
2. **SIMD operations**: Further vectorization for hash operations
3. **Adaptive buffer sizing**: Dynamic strategy based on file characteristics
4. **Compression-aware reading**: Direct decompression from mmap buffer
5. **Prefetch patterns**: ML-based readahead strategy
